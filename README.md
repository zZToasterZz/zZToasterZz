ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shantanu.
    Since GitHub asked so here goes,<br>
    Professionally I'm a Java developer, mostly working with the Spring Boot framework and the technologies that come with it and a few others web development related stuff.<br>
    My Personal interest is to be an expert at algorithm designing, nowhere even close to my goal though and this lifetime seems too short.
